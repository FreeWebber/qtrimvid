man ffmpeg

-ss position (input/output)
    When used as an input option (before "-i"), seeks in this input
    file to position. Note that in most formats it is not possible to
    seek exactly, so ffmpeg will seek to the closest seek point before
    position.  When transcoding and -accurate_seek is enabled (the
    default), this extra segment between the seek point and position
    will be decoded and discarded. When doing stream copy or when
    -noaccurate_seek is used, it will be preserved.

-sseof position (input)
    Like the "-ss" option but relative to the "end of file". That is
    negative values are earlier in the file, 0 is at EOF.

-t duration (input/output)
    When used as an input option (before "-i"), limit the duration of data read from the
    input file.

    When used as an output option (before an output url), stop writing the output after its
    duration reaches duration.

    duration must be a time duration specification, see the Time duration section in the
    ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

    -to and -t are mutually exclusive and -t has priority.
